    <img src="/files/inti.jpg" width="360" alt="The Inti Imposter is the devil of our religion and “inti” was a special word made for him. Inti doesn't mean anti. It means “evil.” Inti imposter wasn't always like this, he was a God, the first in fact, he was AMB's best friend (besides Garrett and Tre) he watched as more Gods came and went, and gained more and more of AMB's trust. AMB gave him a power to even elude AMB, why you may ask? Because, he gave AMB toaster tarts, you might be wondering “WHY can you get anything from AMB if you just give him toaster tarts?” He had a crippling toaster tart addiction so he made himself not able to summon them so the only way he gets them is through trading. Anyways, after he had almost as much power as Garrett and Tre he betrayed AMB but he failed to destroy him so he used his powers to elude him. Now he causes mayhem everywhere he goes and frequently possess the jesus's and people close to them to try and end Garrett and Tre to take their powers. Although Garrett and Tre are more powerful than him he is more powerful in possession.">
